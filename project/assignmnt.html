			Microprocessor technology
			</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;">
				The microprocessor is the central unit of a computer system that performs arithmetic and logic operations, which generally include adding, subtracting, transferring numbers from one area to another, and comparing two numbers. It's often known simply as a processor, a central processing unit, or as a logic chip. It's essentially the engine or the brain of the computer that goes into motion when the computer is switched on. It's a programmable, multipurpose device that incorporates the functions of a CPU (central processing unit) on a single IC (integrated circuit).

		 Vaccum Tube
		 </h3>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		    Alternatively called an electron tube or valve and first developed by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904. The vacuum tube is a glass tube with its gas removed, creating a vacuum. Vacuum tubes contain electrodes for controlling electron flow and were used in early computers as a switch or an amplifier. The picture shows a collection of different vacuum tubes used with different devices.

Evolution of Sensors
</h4>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		    Sensor technology is the measurement of various information by sensors. Sensor technology is a general term for technologies that quantify and utilize information obtained by sensing in this way. Sensor technology includes measurement, quantification, and transmission.
In sensor technology, various possibilities are created by applying quantitative data obtained by sensors. The spread of IoT has further increased its potential and importance. In the IoT where things and the Internet are connected, what is actually handled is information that represents the state of things. Sensor technology plays a role in acquiring this information, and it is expected to be applied to all industries as an indispensable technology for IoT.

ARM
</h5>
		  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
		    An Arm processor is one of a family of central processing units (CPUs) based on the reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture for computer processors. Arm Limited, the company behind the Arm processor, designs the core CPU components and licenses the intellectual property to partner organizations, which then build Arm-based chips according to their own requirements. Arm Limited does not manufacture or sell any chips directly.
